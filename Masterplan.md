## Application Architecture

### System Overview
React Frontend (Form Interface) communicates with Node.js Backend (Express API) which uses Puppeteer for PDF Generation and returns PDF Response for download.

### Data Flow
1. User fills out React form
2. Form data validated on frontend
3. Data sent to Express API endpoint
4. Puppeteer generates PDF from HTML template
5. PDF returned to frontend for download

### Project Organization
Project will be organized with separate frontend and backend folders, containing source code for components, pages, hooks, utilities on frontend side and routes, templates, services on backend side.

## Development Strategy (ASAP Timeline)

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Priority: Get working version quickly**

**Frontend Development:**
- Set up React project with TypeScript
- Create basic form components with Tailwind CSS
- Implement form state management with React Hook Form
- Add dynamic day addition/removal functionality
- Basic form validation

**Backend Development:**
- Set up Node.js/Express server
- Create PDF generation endpoint
- Implement basic Puppeteer PDF template
- File upload handling for company logo

**PDF Template:**
- Simple single-column layout
- Basic company branding integration
- Essential sections (trip info, itinerary, pricing)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 3-4)
**Priority: Improve user experience and PDF quality**

**Frontend Improvements:**
- Enhanced form UI/UX with better styling
- Real-time form validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for tablets

**Backend Improvements:**
- Improved error handling
- PDF template enhancements
- Better data validation
- Image optimization for logos

**PDF Template:**
- Multi-column layouts
- Better typography and spacing
- Enhanced branding integration
- Closer match to sample design

### Phase 3: Professional Polish (Week 5-6)
**Priority: Match professional standards**

**Final Features:**
- Complex PDF layouts exactly matching sample
- Advanced form features (auto-save, draft mode)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing

## Detailed Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components Structure

**Main Components:**
The application will have a main App component containing CompanyBrandingSetup for one-time configuration, ItineraryForm with multiple sub-components including BasicTripInfo, InclusionsExclusions, DynamicDayItinerary, AccommodationDetails, TransferTourInfo, and AdditionalSections, plus a PDFGenerator component.

**State Management:**
React Hook Form will handle form management, useState for UI states like loading and errors, custom hooks for reusable logic, and Context API for company branding if needed across components.

### Backend API Structure

**Main Endpoints:**
The API will have a generate-pdf endpoint that accepts form data, validates input, generates PDF with Puppeteer and returns the PDF file. An upload-logo endpoint will handle company logo uploads, validate file type and size, and store for PDF generation. A company-settings endpoint will return saved company branding for form defaults.

**PDF Generation Process:**
The backend will receive form data via API, validate and sanitize input, load HTML template with data, apply company branding including logo and colors, generate PDF with Puppeteer, and return PDF as downloadable file.

### Puppeteer Implementation

**PDF Template Approach:**
HTML template with embedded CSS, dynamic data injection, company branding integration, and responsive layout optimized for PDF format.

**Template Structure:**
PDF template will contain HTML structure with PDF-specific CSS styling, including header section for company branding, main sections for trip details and day-by-day itinerary, and footer for contact information.

## Conceptual Data Model

### Form Data Structure
The application will handle comprehensive travel itinerary data including basic information like customer name, destination, travel dates, duration, number of travelers (adults and children), pricing details, and trip ID. Content sections will include inclusions, exclusions, and dynamic daily itinerary with day number, title, and description for each day. Additional information sections will cover accommodations, transfers, flights, payment details, cancellation policy, FAQ, and additional notes.

### Company Branding Structure
Company configuration will include logo file upload, company name, contact information (phone, email, website, address), social media handles (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), and brand colors (primary, secondary, accent) for consistent PDF styling.

## User Interface Design Principles

### Form Design (React + Tailwind)
- **Single scrollable page** with smooth section transitions
- **Card-based layout** for logical section grouping
- **Progressive disclosure** with collapsible sections
- **Dynamic form sections** with smooth animations
- **Real-time validation** with inline error messages
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and tablets

### Component Design Patterns
- **Controlled components** for all form inputs
- **Custom hooks** for form logic reuse
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling
- **Loading states** for PDF generation feedback

### PDF Output Design
- **Phase 1:** Clean, professional single-column layout
- **Phase 2:** Multi-column design with better typography
- **Phase 3:** Exact replication of sample design complexity
- **Consistent branding** integrated throughout

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- Input validation with TypeScript types
- XSS prevention with proper data sanitization
- File upload restrictions (type, size)
- Environment variable management

### Backend Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload security (virus scanning optional)
- Rate limiting for PDF generation
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration for internal use

### Deployment Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Secure file storage for uploaded logos
- Regular dependency updates
